                I'm a full-stack designer who is passionate about bringing new product ideas to life from development to marketing. I naturally enjoy design but have become an engineer by necessity. Iâ€™ve worked for startups in design and growth roles. I fell in love with how service design could be innovated through software development, so I switched over. In parallel with my commitment to work on products, I derive from my experience as a college athlete and competing in CrossFit when it comes to, coachability, and working with teams.

                Previously I was a Growth Manager and Designer at Hitch. Currently, I am a Computer Science and Engineering student living in central Texas. Outside of tech I used to play college football, and still fulfill my desire to compete in CrossFit.
